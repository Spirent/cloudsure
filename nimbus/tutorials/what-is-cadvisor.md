# What is cAdvisor?
cAdvisor (Container Advisor) is an open-source tool that provides resource usage and performance analysis for containerized applications. The most common cAdvisor metrics include:

1. CPU usage: cAdvisor monitors the CPU usage of containers, providing information on the amount of CPU time consumed by each container.
2. Memory usage: cAdvisor monitors the amount of memory used by containers, including the amount of memory that is being used by processes running inside the container.
3. Network traffic: cAdvisor provides information on the amount of network traffic generated by each container, including the amount of data sent and received.
4. Disk I/O: cAdvisor monitors the amount of disk I/O generated by each container, including the number of reads and writes.
5. Filesystem usage: cAdvisor provides information on the amount of disk space used by each container, including the number of files and directories.
6. Container uptime: cAdvisor monitors the amount of time each container has been running, including the start time and the current uptime.
7. CPU throttling: cAdvisor provides information on whether containers are being throttled due to CPU usage exceeding their limits.
8. Memory throttling: cAdvisor monitors whether containers are being throttled due to memory usage exceeding their limits.
9. Container status: cAdvisor provides information on the status of each container, including whether it is running or stopped.
10. Container resource limits: cAdvisor monitors the resource limits set for each container, including CPU and memory limits.

These metrics can be useful for monitoring the performance and resource usage of containerized applications, and for identifying and resolving issues that may arise.
