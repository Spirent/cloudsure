# What is Node-exporter?

Node-exporter is a popular open-source tool used for collecting system-level metrics from a node, such as a server or a virtual machine. Some common Node-exporter metrics include:
1. CPU metrics: CPU usage, load average, and interrupts.
2. Memory metrics: total memory, free memory, and swap usage.
3. Disk metrics: disk usage, I/O activity, and disk errors.
4. Network metrics: network usage, TCP connections, and UDP packets.
5. Filesystem metrics: total, used, and free space for each mounted filesystem.
6. Process metrics: number of processes, CPU and memory usage per process, and number of file descriptors used.
7. Time metrics: system time, uptime, and time spent in different states (e.g. idle, user, system).
8. Temperature metrics: temperature of various system components (if supported).
9. Power supply metrics: voltage, current, and power consumption (if supported).
10. Hardware metrics: information about the hardware, such as CPU model, number of cores, and system architecture.

These metrics can be collected by Node-exporter and sent to a monitoring system, such as Prometheus, for further analysis and visualization. They can provide valuable insights into the performance and health of the node, and help identify potential issues or bottlenecks.
